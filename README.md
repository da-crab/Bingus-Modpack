# Bingus-Modpack


## Overview
1.20.1 Minecraft Modpack using Modrinth App

## Installation
1. Download [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) and install.

2. Download .mrpack file from [latest release](https://github.com/da-crab/Bingus-Modpack/releases)

3. Open .mrpack file and accept prompt to open with Modrinth App.

## Setup
> A lot of the following options will be based on your device specifications.

- When you load into a world, you may notice from the FPS counter that Vsync is on. If you want to mess with those options, go to `Video Settings...` in the settings menu. Vsync and max framerate can be changed in `General`, while the FPS counter can be toggled on and off in `Extras`.


## Keybinds 
- The mods included in this pack have a number of additional keybinds. To customize them yourself, you can go to `Controls`, then to 'Keybinds` in the settings menu. A couple that you will definitely make use of are:

- `k` to toggle on and off shaders
- `r` to reload shaders (if necessary)
- `b` to open your backpack
- press and hold `c` to zoom
