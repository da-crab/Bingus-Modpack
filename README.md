# Bingus-Modpack

## Overview
1.20.1 Minecraft Modpack using Modrinth App

## Installation
1. Download [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) and install.

2. Download .mrpack file from [latest release](https://github.com/da-crab/Bingus-Modpack/releases)

3. Open .mrpack file and accept prompt to open with Modrinth App.

## Setup
> A lot of the following options will be based on your device specifications.

### Joining a World
- Send me your username so I can add you as a friend, from there I should be able to invite you to the server while I am playing. I have yet to set up a standalone server that can run full-time.

### Video Settings
- When you load into a world, you may notice from the FPS counter that Vsync is on. If you want to mess with those options, go to `Video Settings...` in the settings menu.
-Vsync and max framerate can be changed in `General`.
    - Also make sure that fullscreen is enabled, for performance reasons.
-FPS counter can be toggled on and off in `Extras`. 
-You shouldn't have to change anything in the other areas.

### Shaders
- In the top right corner of `Video Settings...`, you'll find the `Shader Packs` menu. Here, you'll be able to choose either Makeup Ultrafast (Great for lower-end PCs if you still want to use shaders), or Complementary Reimagined (In my opinion the best looking shaders). If you'd like to request other shader packs you like, just let me know, or you can just drag and drop them straight in yourself.
- Keep in mind that, by default, the shaders are set to their minimum quality settings to stop lower-end devices from getting frozen while loading in the shaders. You'll want to go to `Shader Pack Settings...` after clicking on your desired shader pack and click through the profiles until you find one you like that still runs well. (At minimum you want to be consistently above 60 fps, but mess around until you find what seems smooth for you).

### Keybinds 
- The mods included in this pack have a number of additional keybinds. To customize them yourself, you can go to `Controls`, then to `Keybinds...` in the settings menu. A couple that you may make use of are:
> Remember you can always edit these yourself from the keybinds menu

- `k` to toggle on and off shaders
- `r` to reload shaders (if necessary)
- `b` to open your backpack (You have to craft one first)
- press and hold `c` to zoom (scroll while holding to zoom further)
- `n` to cycle trades with villagers
- `y` while hovering over an item in your inventory to search for it in nearby chests. (Nearby chests containing the item will be highlighted)
- `` ` `` to search nearby chests for any item (works the same as y)
- `l` for advancements
- `p` (or `double-click` an empty inventory slot) to sort any inventory (including a chest)
- Additionally, holding a fishing rod in the last slot of your hotbar enables autofishing, so you can zen out for a couple hours.
